## What can Overlabels do?
Currently, you can create alerts and overlays for your Twitch channel 
by writing a few lines of HTML and CSS and sprinkle in a few Template Tags.

## What are Template Tags?
Template Tags are a way to inject live Twitch data into your HTML. Their syntax is simple:
```html
[[[followers_count]]]
```
You can find the full list of Template Tags after you log in.
